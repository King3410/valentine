      <h1>Hey my Baby Girl! ❤️</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, Baby Nadine! I know this is a bit late for Valentine’s Day, but it’s
        still early for our monthsary. I just want you to take a minute to read
        this. I know this isn’t the typical handwritten letter or anything like
        that, but I’m doing this with passion and effort, and it’s aligned with
        what I love to do even though I hate programming HAHAHA (Paldo na naman
        si nadine). We’ve been together for two years now, right? Wow, that was
        fast. It feels like it was just yesterday when we first talked on the
        phone. “Sorry, my fingers are getting stiff, Is it okay if I call you?.”
        I think that’s the line I can proudly say that got your attention for a
        long time. I really wanted to give you something like this a long time
        ago, but I realized it all stayed in my mind. I kept making plans but
        never finished anything, because I wanted it to be perfect. I wanted you
        to feel special, because you are my first in so many ways. I’m sorry for
        having that kind of attitude. As you continue reading this message, I
        hope you’ll have a lot of patience hihi. I love you so much.
      </p>

            <p>
                Gagi ka, love. It’s been an amazing journey with you, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us. You are my sunshine on a cloudy day, my rock when I need support, and my best friend through it all. I’m so grateful to have you in my life, and I promise to cherish and love you every single day. Happy Valentine’s Day, my love!

Akalain mo yun, sa sobrang tamad at bagal ko gumawa, nakagawa pa rin ako ng ganito. HAHAHAHA, kidding asidethank you for coming into my life. I hope you can lessen your hurtful words toward me, huhu.

First of all, I want to say sorry for all the times na nasaktan kita, na nagalit ka sa akin, nagtampo ka, napaiyak ka dahil sa akin, at sa lahat ng mga hindi magagandang bagay na nangyari sa pagitan nating dalawa. I know hindi ako perfect, and I know marami pa akong dapat i-improve sa sarili ko, but I want you to know that I’m really trying my best to be a better person for you and for us. I want to be the kind of boyfriend you deservethe kind who can make you happy, make you feel loved and special. I want to be the one who supports your dreams and aspirations, the one who’s there for you in good times and bad, and the one who loves you unconditionally. I hope you can forgive me for all my mistakes and shortcomings, and I hope we can continue to grow together as a couple. I love you so much, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

I’m really sorry for what I said last time, love. Minsan na nga lang ako magsalita ng ganun, nag-regret pa ako. I’m sorry, lovelove na love kita.

Kung dumating man ang time na iiwan mo na ako, can you just block me, okay? Kasi hindi ko talaga kayang mawala ka, promise. Mahal na mahal kita. Broke as fuck lang tayo ngayon, pero huwag ka mag-alalalahat ng na-miss natin, gagawin natin yan, okay? Feeling ko nakalimutan mo na, pero plano ko pa rin yun. You never know.  

I love you, bebii ko. Happy Valentine’s Day.

            <p>HI, Love! Thank you for making this far in my life, we've been 2 years and still counting for the future ahead of us
                This day was sepcial to me when you came to my life, tbh. I'm not a kind of person that demands a lot eh, but when i hear your thoughts,
                feelings and emotion. I learned that sometimes in our life even me wants something in return or like I wanted to feel special too.
                marming stories, kwento, tawa, iyak, inis, galit at pagtatampo sa pagitan natin dalawa, Nagpapasalamat ako ng marami love kasi sa karanasan na yun.
                marami din ako narealize sa sarili ko na shet  kamahal mahal pala akong tao, mahirap pala akong mahalin, masyado akong kuripot sa sarili ko at higit sa
                lahat mabagal kumilos, kahit na minumura mo ako, ansakit mo na magsalita (tbh) at marmai pa na iba. but despite of that  I still choose you and love you.
                why? because you are the only one that can handle me, you are the only one that can understand me, you are the only one that can love me and you are the only one that can make me feel special. I know na hindi ako perfect, but i promise to be a better version of myself for you and for us. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, I want to grow old with you, I want to create memories with you and I want to love you forever. 
                so for the 1million question, will you be my girlfriend,bestfriend, and wife this lifetime?</p>
